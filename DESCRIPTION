Description: A group of functions that detect and test for changes in covariance structures of functional data, as well as changepoint detection for multivariate data more generally. Method for detecting non-stationarity in resting state fMRI scans as seen in Ramsay, K., & Chenouri, S. (2025) <doi:10.1080/10485252.2025.2503891> is implemented in 'fmri_changepoints()'. Also includes depth- and rank-based implementation of the WBS algorithm for detecting multiple changepoints in multivariate data.
