# KWCChangepoint: Robust Changepoint Detection for Functional and Multivariate Data

Detect and test for changes in covariance structures of functional data,
as well as changepoint detection for multivariate data more generally.
Method for detecting non-stationarity in resting state functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scans as seen in Ramsay, K., &
Chenouri, S. (2025)

is implemented in fmri_changepoints(). Also includes depth- and
rank-based implementation of the wild binary segmentation algorithm for
detecting multiple changepoints in multivariate data.
