\title{Pairwise comparison post-hoc hypothesis test for differences in covariance
operators using Functional Kruskal–Wallis Tests for Covariance.}
\usage{
FKWC_posthoc(data, derivs, g, p = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Functional data in fdata form, where each row is an observation
and each column is a dimension.}

\item{derivs}{First order derivative of the functional data in fdata form.}

\item{g}{Factor object that indicates which sample each row of data belongs
to.}

\item{p}{Number of random projections to be generated in order to compute
random projection depths of the data.}
}
\value{
A matrix of p-values for each pairwise comparison with a Šidák
  correction applied.
