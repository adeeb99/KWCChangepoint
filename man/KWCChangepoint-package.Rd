\title{KWCChangepoint: Robust Changepoint Detection for Functional and Multivariate Data}
\description{
Detect and test for changes in covariance structures of functional data, as well as changepoint detection for multivariate data more generally. Method for detecting non-stationarity in resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scans as seen in Ramsay, K., & Chenouri, S. (2025) \doi{10.1080/10485252.2025.2503891} is implemented in fmri_changepoints(). Also includes depth- and rank-based implementation of the wild binary segmentation algorithm for detecting multiple changepoints in multivariate data.
